# html-recipe
In this assignment, you will make a webpage to describe making some food.  This could be as simple as making a sandwich or as complex as you like. When you are deciding how to present your content, think about the sections that you would like to have. Think about a section that introduces what is being done, one to discuss ingredients and one that goes over the steps to prepare.
